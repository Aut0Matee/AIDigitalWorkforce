# PRD: AI Digital Workforce (AutoMate)

## 1. Overview
**Project Name:** AI Digital Workforce  
**Goal:** Build an open-source multi-agent AI platform where specialized AI agents (Researcher, Writer, Analyst, Developer) collaborate to complete complex tasks in real time.  
**Purpose:** Showcase AutoMate’s AI automation capabilities, attract open-source community attention, and serve as a foundation for future SaaS offerings.  
**Primary Audience:** Startups, solopreneurs, marketers, and tech enthusiasts.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Create a **wow-factor demo** of AI agents collaborating in real time.
- Demonstrate **multi-agent orchestration** and AI-driven task automation.
- Provide a **user-friendly dashboard** to assign tasks and view results.
- Enable **exportable deliverables** (PDF, Markdown, Google Docs).
- Make it **open-source** with clean architecture for community contributions.

---

## 3. Success Metrics
- **Public Reception:** GitHub stars, shares on LinkedIn/Twitter, demo traffic.
- **Technical Goal:** Seamless agent interactions with <3 sec latency per message.
- **User Engagement:** Average session length (people “watch” agents collaborate).
- **Adoption Potential:** Feasibility to evolve into B2B SaaS (custom AI teams).

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Role-Based Agents
- Predefined agents:
  - **Researcher:** Gathers and summarizes data from the web.
  - **Writer:** Drafts human-like content (blogs, summaries, emails).
  - **Analyst:** Reviews, critiques, and improves outputs.
  - **Developer (future optional):** Generates simple code snippets or scripts.
- Each role has distinct **system prompts** and **behavior patterns**.

### 4.2 Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Agents communicate with each other in **real-time chat** (visible to user).
- Task flow: Research → Draft → Review → Final Output.
- Human user can **interject** to provide direction or feedback.

### 4.3 Task Management
- Users create a task with title + brief description.
- Task displayed in **task panel** with status (In Progress, Completed).
- Deliverables stored and downloadable.

### 4.4 Real-Time Interface
- **Chat-like UI**: Avatars, message bubbles, typing indicators.
- Live updates as agents converse and work.
- Side panel: task list, current task status, history.

### 4.5 Deliverable Export
- Export results as:
  - Markdown
  - PDF
  - Google Docs (optional future integration)

## 6. User Journeys

### Journey 1: Task Creation & Collaboration
1. User visits dashboard.
2. Clicks **"Create New Task"**.
3. Enters task: *"Summarize top EV startups in 2025 and draft a 500-word blog post."*
4. Agents initiate chat:
   - Researcher: Finds top EV startups.
   - Writer: Drafts blog post based on research.
   - Analyst: Reviews and improves content.
5. User sees conversation unfold in real time.
6. Final output available for download.

### Journey 2: Human Intervention
1. During agent conversation, user clicks **"Interject"**.
2. Types: *"Focus only on Asia market."*
3. Agents adjust approach and re-align task.

### Journey 3: Export & Reuse
1. Task completed → user clicks **"Export"**.
2. Downloads PDF/Markdown for internal use.
3. Optionally creates new task with previous output as context.
